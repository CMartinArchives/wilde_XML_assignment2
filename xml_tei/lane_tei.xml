              Wilde’s first major society comedy, set in fashionable London drawing rooms and 
              exploring jealousy, scandal, and maternal sacrifice. In the letter, Wilde cites 
              this play as a typographical model for how the U.S. copyright notice should be 
              printed in the edition of <title ref="#work_woman_no_importance" rend="italic">The Woman of No Importance</title>.

              A society comedy exposing double standards in Victorian morality through the fate 
              of Mrs. Arbuthnot, a “fallen woman” confronting the aristocrat who ruined her. 
              Wilde discusses here its simultaneous copyright in America and the timing of the 
              book’s publication to coincide with the provincial tour of the play.

              A hybrid tale combining literary criticism and fictional forgery, built on the idea 
              that Shakespeare’s Sonnets were inspired by a boy-actor named Willie Hughes. 
              In the letter, Wilde suggests that Elkin Mathews might publish a new edition of the 
              work, with altered print run and price.

              In the early 1890s, Oscar Wilde was at the height of his literary career, 
              publishing a series of successful society comedies with 
              <persName ref="#pers_lane">John Lane</persName> at 
              <orgName ref="#org_bodley_head">The Bodley Head</orgName>. 
              This letter reflects Wilde’s close involvement in the material and commercial 
              aspects of publication, including proof correction, pricing, and arrangements 
              for American copyright.

              Constance Mary Lloyd (1859–1898), later Constance Wilde, was an Irish writer and activist involved 
              in dress reform and women's rights. She married <persName ref="#pers_wilde">Oscar Wilde</persName> in 1884 
              and played a significant role in shaping his early literary and public life. 
              In the summer of 1894, while living in <placeName ref="#place_worthing">Worthing</placeName>, she compiled 
              a selection of Wilde’s epigrams and aphorisms, later privately printed as 
              <title type="work" rend="italic">Oscariana</title>.  
              After Wilde’s trial and imprisonment in 1895, Constance changed her surname 
              and that of her children to “Holland.” She died in 1898 following spinal surgery.

              Worthing is a seaside town in West Sussex, England. 
              Wilde stayed there in the summer of 1894, during which he named one of his 
              principal characters “Jack Worthing” in 
              <title type="work" rend="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</title>. 
              This letter was written from Worthing, from the address “5 Esplanade”.

              Liverpool is a port city in northwest England. Wilde notes in this letter that 
              <title type="work" rend="italic">The Woman of No Importance</title> 
              had been lectured on there and used as a topic for sermons, and that the play 
              should therefore have a good sale in the city.

            <note>
              New York is mentioned in connection with arrangements for American copyright. 
              Wilde explains that he is sending proofs of 
              <title type="work" rend="italic">The Woman of No Importance</title> to New York so that 
              copyright can be secured in the United States before publication.
